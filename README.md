# Inventory Suggestions

This is a work in progress plugin for Runelite that aims to provide suggestions for various activities in runescape.

## Planned features of the project

1) All PVM bosses will be included with reccomendations. The currently planned method of ranking the various
   equipment will be a combination of information from various sources, such as the old school wiki, gear discord and various
   content creators. This is to hopefully provide an accurate reccomendation as some players have feedback that relying on
   wiki alone is not a good idea as there are many reccomendations that they disagree with, and the wiki does not account for
   niche equipment that may be reasonable sidegrades which may benefit players such as ironmen or low budget players.
2) Bosses with Multiple ways to tackle will allow the player to choose their preferred method via a drop-down menu (i.e zulrah mage only, range only, hybrid).
3) Bosses that the player may be ill-equipped for (i.e not having the spellbook, the minimum reccomended equipment) will be marked out
   and reccomend the minimum upgrades the player should have. As stated in point 1, this ideally will be discussed with
   various sources and ran through dps calculators to make it as accurate as possible.
4) Potentially allow for the player to save their load out. My vision is that after the player has been reccomended the ideal loadout,
   they can edit it to suit their supply needs and save it for ease of access in the future. Potential idea can be for equipment with upgrades
   found in the bank (i.e saved loadout having iban staff with trident in the bank) being highlighted and the upgrade mentioned. This saved loadout
   is currently planned to be in the same space as the dropdown menu in point 2 above.

Do note that the idea in point 4 will need to go through a bit more thought, as I personally feel conflicted with this feature being added
due to the plugin "inventory setups" serving a similar functionality. I will have to ask for more feedback later into development
